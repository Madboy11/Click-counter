# Click Counter

## Overview
The **Click Counter** is a simple web-based application that tracks the number of clicks made by the user and calculates the average clicks per second in real-time. It provides a visual display of the total clicks and the average click rate, updating continuously as the user interacts with the application.

## Features
- **Real-Time Updates**: The average clicks per second are updated continuously without requiring additional clicks.
- **Dynamic Styling**: The result display is styled dynamically for better user experience.
- **Lightweight and Responsive**: The application is built using minimal JavaScript and is highly responsive.

## How It Works
1. The user clicks on the designated area.
2. The application starts tracking the time from the first click.
3. The total number of clicks and the average clicks per second are displayed and updated in real-time.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for counting clicks and calculating the average.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Start clicking in the designated area to see the counter and average click rate in action.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a reset button to restart the counter and timer.
- Include a leaderboard to track the highest click rates.
- Make the application mobile-friendly with responsive design.
